abstract: Specialized ray-tracing acceleration units have become a common feature in GPU hardware, enabling real-time ray-tracing of complex scenes for the first time. The ray-tracing unit accelerates the traversal of a hierarchical tree data structure called a bounding volume hierarchy to determine whether rays have intersected triangle primitives. Hierarchical search algorithms are a fundamental software pattern common in many important domains, such as recommendation systems and point cloud registration, but are difficult for GPUs to accelerate because they are characterized by extensive branching and recursion. The ray-tracing unit overcomes these limitations with specialized hardware to traverse hierarchical data structures efficiently but is mired by a highly specialized graphics API, which is not readily adaptable to general-purpose computation. We present the Hierarchical Search Unit (HSU), a flexible datapath to accelerate a more general class of hierarchical search algorithms, of which ray-tracing is one. We synthesize a baseline ray-intersection datapath and maximize functional unit reuse while extending the ray-tracing unit to support additional computations and a more general set of instructions. We demonstrate that the unit can improve the performance of three hierarchical search data structures in approximate nearest neighbors search algorithms and a B-tree key-value store index. For a minimal extension to the existing unit, our HSU improves the state-of-the-art GPU approximate nearest neighbor implementation by an average of 24.8% using the GPUâ€™s general computing interface

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We propose the Hierarchical Search Unit, a generalization of the GPU's Ray Tracing Unit that accelerates the traversal of data with diverse dimensions and characteristics.
